I am always interested in working with self-motivated students on challening research problems. Before reaching out to me, kindly take the time to read this post.  I will provide some general advice that is applicable to all students, followed by specific advice tailored to different categories of students.

<h3>For all students</h3>
When getting in touch with me, kindly provide a comprehensive curriculum vitae (CV) that outlines your educational achievements, any previous research experience you may have had, references to any code you have authored, and a list of software programs with which you are proficient.
